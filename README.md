  <h1>Text to Speech Converter</h1>
  <p>This is a simple Text to Speech Converter application implemented in Python using the Tkinter library and the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) API. It allows users to input text and convert it into speech, which can be played back instantly.</p>
  
  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Easy-to-Use Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for entering text and generating speech.</li>
      <li>Customizable Text: Users can input any text they want to be converted into speech.</li>
      <li>Supports Multiple Languages: Supports various languages for speech generation.</li>
      <li>Instant Playback: Converts text to speech and plays it back immediately.</li>
      <li>Save Speech: Option to save the generated speech as an audio file.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Run the Program: Execute the <code>text_to_speech.py</code> file to launch the application.</li>
      <li>Enter Text: Input the text you want to convert into speech in the text box provided.</li>
      <li>Convert to Speech: Click the "Convert to Speech" button to generate speech from the entered text.</li>
      <li>Playback: The generated speech will start playing automatically.</li>
      <li>Save Speech: Optionally, you can save the generated speech as an audio file.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Python 3.x</li>
      <li>Tkinter library</li>
      <li>gTTS library (can be installed via <code>pip install gtts</code>)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>Clone this repository to your local machine.</li>
      <li>Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.</li>
      <li>Run the <code>text_to_speech.py</code> file using Python.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Internet Dependency</h2>
  <p>This project relies on the gTTS library, which uses the Google Text-to-Speech API to generate speech. Therefore, an internet connection is required to download the necessary language files for speech synthesis. Once these files are downloaded, the application should work offline.</p>
